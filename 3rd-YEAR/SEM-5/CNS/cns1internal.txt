-----------Computer network Security ------------------
Computer network security consists of measures taken by
some organizations or business to monitor and prevent
unauthorized access from the outside attackers/hackers 

----------- privacy ---------------------------------
Privacy implies both the sender and the receiver
expects confidentiality The transmitted message ought to be
sent uniquely to the planned receiver while the message ought
to be misty for different clients.
-------------Authentication---------------------------
Authentication means that the receiver is
sure of the sender identity, i e , no unauthorised person has
sent the message 
------------ Non repudiation -------------------------
Non Repudiation means that the receiver
must be able to prove that the received message has come
from a specific sender The sender must not deny sending a
message that he or she send
----------- Threats Of Security ----------------------
Viruses and Worms
Intruders
Insiders
Criminal
Organizations
Terrorists
Information Warfare
----------Viruses -------------------------------------
-> A computer virus is a malicious program that self-replicates via
copying itself to another program.

->Almost all viruses are connected to an executable document, which
means the virus may also exist on your pc but it surely cannot infect
your computer unless you run or open the malicious program.
->It is important to note that a virus cannot be spread without a human
action.
-----------------Worms ------------------------------
-> Worm is similar to a virus by design and is considered to be a
sub-class of a virus.
-> Worms spread from computer to computer , but in contrast to a
pandemic, it has the functionality to travel without human action.

-------------------Intruders---------------------------
->  One of the 2 most publicized threats to safety is the intruder
 which is frequently known as hacker or cracker.
There Intruders can be classified into three classes :-
	1)Masqueraider :- 
 An individual who isn't always authorized to use the computer
and who penetrates a gadget’s access controls to make the most a
legitimate consumer’s account.
	2) Intruders :- 
 A valid consumer who accesses records, packages, or sources for which
such access isn't always legal, or who is legal for such access however
misuses his or her privileges.
	3) Clandestine user :-
 An person who takeover supervisory manage of the system and uses
this control to suppress audit collection.

--------------------Insiders ---------------------------
-> Insider is a threat to an Organization's Data which can be
intentionally misused by any legal authority of the organization.
-------------------Terrorists---------------------------
-> The terrorists use cyberspace to cause uncertainty.
-> Cyber attacks occur in two forms, one used to attack data,
and others focused on control system.
--------------Information Warfare------------------------
->Information warfare (IW) is a concept involving the
warfare area use and management of information and
verbal exchange era in pursuit of a aggressive advantage
over an opponent.
----------------Criminal Organization--------------------
-> Organized crime is a class of transnational, countrywide, 
or neighbourhood groupings of fairly centralized
organizations run through criminals who intend to interact
in illegal interest, maximum usually for money and profit

-------------Avenue Of Atttack ------------------------
-> Two reasons for attacks:-
	1) Specifically targeted by the attacker
	2) Opportunistic target

----------------Steps In Attack -----------------------
Step 1 :- Information gathering: The attacker will gather as much information about
	organization as possible.
Step 2 :- Determination of target system: Then determine what target systems are
	available and active.
Step 3 :- Find vulnerability & suitable tools: To perform a port scan which gives
	indication of which services are running on target machine.
Step 4 :- Attack to the target system.

----------------Security Basis ----------------------------
-> Confidentiality
-> Integrity
-> Availability
--------------- Confidentiality---------------------------
-> Confidentiality means protecting or securing the data and the information from
	unauthorized parties.
------------------Integrity ---------------------------------
-> It refers to protecting information from being modified by
unauthorized parties.
-> Information only has value if it is correct. Information that has
been tampered with could prove costly.
-------------------- Availablity ----------------------------
-> Availability means that information is accessible to authorized
users. It is basically an assurance that your system and data
are accessible by authorized users whenever it’s needed.

-----------------Types Of Attack ----------------------------
 1) Passive Atacks :-  A Passive attack attempts to learn or
 make use of information from the system but does not affect 
 system resource
 2) Active Attacks :-  An Active attack attempts to alter system resources or affect
their operations.

--------------Types of Attack --------------------------
 backdoors and trapdoors
 sniffing
 Spoofing
 TCP/IP Hacking,
 Phishing attacks,
 Distributed DOS,
 SQL Injection
 Malware : Viruses , Logic Bombs

------------------------------------------	-----------Hill Cipher----------------------------------------------------
This multi-letter cipher is developed by the mathematician lester hill in
1929.
Formula to Encrypt :-
		[c1 c2] = [k11 k12 k21 k22] x [1 2] mod 26

--------------------------------------------------PlayFair Cipher ---------------------------------------------------
-> The Playfair cipher uses a 5 by 5 table containing a key word or phrase.
-> To encrypt a message, one would break the message into digraph such that, 
	for example, "HelloWorld" becomes "HE LL OW OR LD", and map them out 
	on the key table.
-> Rules :- 
1) if both letters are the same , add an "x" or "Q" .
2) if letters appears on the same row of your table , then replace them with rigth side of letter.
3) if letters appears on the same column of your table , then replace with downwards of the letter.
4) if the letters doesnot appear to be in same row or column then make a row and replace it with the same column downwards or upwards.
-> method :- 
1) in 5 X 5 matrix first write down the key value.
2) after completing key value complete all the alphabets , taking care no repeating the same letter.
3) put i and j in the same block.
----------------------------------Vigenere Cipher-----------------------------------------------------------------
->  The Vigenère cipher consists of several Caesar ciphers in sequence with
different shift values. 
 encryption -  Ci = (Pi + Ki) mod 26
 decryption -  Pi = (Ci - Ki) mod 26

------------------------------- Caesar Cipher -----------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Encrpytion :- En(x) = (x + n) mod 26
-> Decryption :- Dn(x) = (x - n) mod 26
