---> explain class and object with example.
	A class is a template that specifies the attributes and behaviour of things or objects.

----> It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.

---> example :- 
class Box{
	double width =1;
	double height =1;
	double depth = 3;
double volume(){
	return(width*height*depth);
}
}
------> Calling of method
syntax :- 
	object_name.method_name(parameter-list);
example:- Box B1 = new Box();
	  B1.volume();

-----> Objects
--> An entity that has state and behaviour is known as an object.
--> An object is an instance of a class.
------> how to declare an object:-
--> syntax : class_name object_name = new class_name();

Example :
        Student s1 = new Student();
