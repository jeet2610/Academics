'Static keyword'
The static keyword in java is used for memory management mainly.

The static keyword can be used with :
- variable 
- method
-block
- nested class
	 If you declare any variable as static , it is known as a static variable.
	The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.

Advantage:- Efficient memory management.
- if you apply static keyword with any method , it is known as static mathod.
	- static method belongs to the class.
	- A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
- A static method can access staatic data member.	
- this and super cannot be used in static context.

class Test{
	static void printdata(){
	System.out.println("static mehod");
}
public static void main(String[] args){
	printdata();
}
}

-----'Static Block'-------
	it is used to intialize the static data member
	executed before the main method

	class A2{
	static{
	System.out.print("Static block is invoked");
}
}
	public static void main(String args[]){
		System.out.println("Main method");
}

WAP with the use of static variable mathod and block.
