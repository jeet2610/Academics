An array is an indexed collection of fixed number of homogeneous data elements.
The main advantage os arrays is we can represent huge number values by using single variable , so that readability of the code will be improved.
But , the main disadv of arrays is fixed in size ,. that is once array is created , there is no chance of increasing or decreasing the isze based on our requirement. hence , to use array concept compulsory we should know the size in advance , which may not possible always.




Array Declaration :- 
	1-d declaration :-

			int x[];

Two dimensional :-
