 Derived data types are those which used to store multiple values of same type.
They are made by using any other data type for example, arrays.
	int a[]= new int[5];

	Literals means constants values like 1, 1234, -45 , 3.14 , "Hello".

In java an identifier can be a class name , method name , variable name or a label.
